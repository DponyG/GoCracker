# GoCracker

A Bruteforce password cracker written in Go. Meant to showcase the strength of a dumb browser in cracking passwords. 

You type in a password and click "Go", this then spins off two threads, one comparing against a 15GB plain text password dump, and the other bruteforcing. Whichever one gets it first wins. You lose either way.
